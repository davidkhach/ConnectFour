ConnectFour game built in Python using the Pygame Library. Users are able to play against another player or against an AI. To drop a disk in a column, players can click anywhere within the column.

What is Connect Four?

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

Current Features:
- Easy to use GUI, players simply have to click anywhere within a column to drop a disk
- Players can play against another human or against an AI
- Current implemented difficulties for AIs are easy and medium.
- Players choose what disk color they want to play as and they will always go first
- Users can create their own custom AIs using the customai.py file, further instructions are found in this file.
- Right column displays which player's turn it currently is.
- Once a player wins, message is displayed on bottom of GUI.

Future plan: 
- Allowing users to play against different difficulties of AI ranging from easy to hard (In Progress)
- Allowing users to easily pick which difficulty AI they want to play against (Not Completed)
- Optimizing code to run more efficiently for determining whether there is a win or not (Not Completed)
